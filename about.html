            <p>BTS, also known as the Bangtan Boys, is a South Korean boy band that was formed in 
                2010 and debuted in 2013 under Big Hit Entertainment.[5] The septet—consisting of 
                members Jin, Suga, J-Hope, RM, Jimin, V, and Jungkook—co-writes and co-produces 
                much of their own output. Originally a hip hop group, their musical style has evolved 
                to include a wide range of genres. Their lyrics, often focused on personal and 
                social commentary, touch on the themes of mental health, troubles of school-age 
                youth and coming of age, loss, the journey towards loving oneself, and individualism. 
                Their work also often references literature and psychological concepts and includes an 
                alternative universe storyline.</p>

            <p>After debuting in 2013 with their single album 2 Cool 4 Skool, BTS released their 
                first Korean-language studio album, Dark & Wild, and Japanese-language studio album, 
                Wake Up, in 2014. The group's second Korean studio album, Wings (2016), was their 
                first to sell one million copies in South Korea. By 2017, BTS crossed into the 
                global music market, leading the Korean Wave into the United States and breaking 
                numerous sales records. They became the first Korean group to receive a certification 
                from the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) for their single "Mic Drop", 
                as well as the first Korean act to top the US Billboard 200 with their studio album 
                Love Yourself: Tear (2018). BTS became one of the few groups since the Beatles to 
                earn four US number-one albums in less than two years, and Love Yourself: Answer (2018) 
                was the first Korean album certified Platinum by the RIAA. In 2020, BTS became the 
                first all-South Korean act to reach number one on the Billboard Global 200 and US 
                Billboard Hot 100 with their Grammy-nominated single "Dynamite". Their follow-up 
                releases "Savage Love", "Life Goes On", "Butter", and "Permission to Dance" made BTS 
                the fastest act to accumulate five US number-one singles since Michael Jackson.</p>
